# Baldur's Gate 3 Build Randomizer
This is a build randomizer I've made for Baldur's Gate 3 to add interesting challenges to the game where you try to make a build work with the build this randomizer gives you.

I also made this site as a project to improve my frontend skills with, and built it using vite and react.

## How it works

This is a pretty simple randomizer where you choose the amounts of classes you want to be included into your build from the dropdown menu, and then click the `Generate Build` button to generate your build and get the race and classes for it.
